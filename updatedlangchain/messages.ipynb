    "**What are Messages in LangChain?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Messages in LangChain are the building blocks of conversations between users and language models. Each message represents a single turn in the dialogue, such as a user question or an AI response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importance:**\n",
    "- Messages help structure and manage multi-turn conversations.\n",
    "- They allow the model to keep track of context, history, and roles (user, assistant, system).\n",
    "- Proper use of messages enables more accurate, context-aware, and interactive AI applications."
