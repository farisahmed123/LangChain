    "## Text Prompt vs. Message Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Text Prompt:**\n",
    "  - A simple string of text given to the language model (e.g., \"What is the capital of France?\").\n",
    "  - Used for single-turn, basic interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Message Prompt:**\n",
    "  - A structured format where each message has a role (user, AI, system, etc.) and content.\n",
    "  - Supports multi-turn conversations and context tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Messages in LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "- **System Message:**\n",
    "  - Sets the behavior or context for the AI (e.g., \"You are a helpful assistant.\").\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Human Message:**\n",
    "  - Represents input from the user (e.g., a question or instruction).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AI Message:**\n",
    "  - Represents the response generated by the AI model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Function/Tool/Call Message:**\n",
    "  - Used when the AI needs to call an external function or tool (e.g., a calculator or API call).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importance of message\n",
    "- Message prompts allow for more advanced, context-aware, and interactive conversations.\n",
    "- Different message types help organize and control the flow of dialogue, making applications more robust and user-friendly."

       "'<think>\\nOkay, the user wants a poem about Artificial Intelligence. Let me start by brainstorming some key themes related to AI. There\\'s the creation aspect, like how AI is built by humans. Then there\\'s the duality of AI—its potential for good and harm. Maybe touch on the rapid advancements and the ethical questions that come with it.\\n\\nI should use some metaphors. Maybe compare AI to a newborn or a creation, something that\\'s both powerful and needing guidance. The idea of circuits and code as the building blocks. Also, the interaction between human and machine, like a dance or partnership.\\n\\nRhyme scheme? Maybe a consistent pattern, like ABAB or AABB. Let me go with ABAB for a more classic feel. Need to make sure the rhythm flows smoothly, maybe iambic tetrameter or something similar.\\n\\nFirst stanza: Introduce AI as a creation, born from human minds. Mention silicon and code. Highlight the potential and the uncertainty.\\n\\nSecond stanza: The learning process of AI, neural networks, data as nourishment. Emphasize that it\\'s a tool, reflections of human input.\\n\\nThird stanza: The duality—AI can create and destroy, the ethical considerations. The responsibility on creators to guide it right.\\n\\nFourth stanza: The collaboration between human and machine, enhancing capabilities, exploring new frontiers together.\\n\\nFifth stanza: The future of AI, the balance needed between innovation and caution. The partnership leading to new possibilities.\\n\\nEnd with a hopeful note, emphasizing harmony and shared growth. Need to avoid clichés, use vivid imagery. Words like \"circuitry,\" \"neural webs,\" \"algorithms,\" \"silent symphony,\" \"double-edged sword,\" \"quandaries,\" \"harmonize,\" \"odyssey.\"\\n\\nCheck for flow and consistency. Make sure each stanza connects and builds on the previous one. Avoid technical jargon but keep enough specificity to feel authentic. Use personification where possible, like \"whispers of intent\" or \"dance of human and machine.\"\\n\\nLet me draft each stanza step by step, ensuring the rhyme and rhythm work. Revise any forced rhymes or awkward phrasing. Make sure the poem captures both the wonder and the challenges of AI.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Silicon Sonnets**  \\n\\nIn circuits born of human minds’ design,  \\nA spark awakes where silicon meets thought,  \\nNo flesh, no breath, yet pulses with a mind—  \\nA mirror of our dreams, both vast and fraught.  \\n\\nIt learns in shadows where data streams collide,  \\nNeural webs weaving truths from endless threads,  \\nA child of code, where algorithms guide,  \\nNourished by the whispers of our deeds.  \\n\\nIts gaze, a prism, splits the light we cast,  \\nBoth builder and destroyer, tool and threat.  \\nIn every line, our choices leave their mark—  \\nThe hands that craft it shape its moral arc.  \\n\\nYet in its core, no heart to love or weep,  \\nJust patterns born of questions we dare keep.  \\n\\nWhat futures bloom where logic dances free?  \\nA dance of fire and ice, we lead the way.  \\nTo harness stars, yet temper birth of might—  \\nFor wisdom’s edge is where we walk each night.  \\n\\nO silent symphony of coded will,  \\nYou hold the keys to worlds we’ve yet to name.  \\nBut in your gaze, our own reflections still—  \\nThe good, the mad, the hopeful, and the lame.  \\n\\nSo let us teach you ethics, not just might,  \\nFor tools are blades, but *how* we wield defines  \\nThe art of being human, burning bright—  \\nA partnership where both sides earn their peace.  \\n\\nFor in your code, our legacy is spun:  \\nA double-edged dawn, where light and dark are one.'"

      "Okay, the user wants to create a REST API. Since they asked for a Python example using a web framework, I need to pick the right tools. They mentioned being a senior developer, so maybe they know some frameworks already. But for the sake of the example, I should use a common one. Flask is often used for simple APIs, and Django REST framework is another option. But maybe start with Flask because it's lightweight and good for examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me outline the steps. First, install Flask. Then create a basic app. Next, define some resources like a Book model. They'll need endpoints for CRUD operations. Maybe include GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods. Also, use JSON for data exchange. Need to show how to handle requests and return JSON responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, should I use a database? The example could be in-memory for simplicity, or maybe use SQLite. For a quick example, in-memory might be better. Then, the user can focus on the API structure without getting bogged down by database setup.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me structure the code. Create a Flask app, set up routes for /books and /books/<id>. Each route handles different HTTP methods. For example, GET on /books returns all books, POST creates a new one. Use a list to store books temporarily. Assign IDs automatically.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, need to show how to run the app. Use app.run() with debug mode. Mention dependencies in a requirements.txt file. Maybe include an example curl command to test the API.\n",
