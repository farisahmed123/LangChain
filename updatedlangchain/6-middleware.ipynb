If any are found, the middleware can block the request or return a warning, otherwise it lets the input continue to the main logic. This helps keep your application safe and clean without changing the core processing code."

That\\'s a basic arithmetic question. Let me start by recalling that addition is one of the fundamental operations in mathematics. When you add two numbers together, you\\'re combining their quantities. So 2 plus 2 would be 4. But wait, maybe I should double-check that. Let me count: 2 objects plus another 2 objects make a total of 4 objects. Yes, that seems right.\\n\\nI wonder if there\\'s any context where 2+2 could mean something else. In most everyday situations, it\\'s straightforward addition. But in some specialized fields, like modular arithmetic or different number bases, the result might vary. For example, in base 3, 2+2 would be 11 (which is 4 in decimal). However, unless specified otherwise, the default assumption is base 10. Since the question doesn\\'t mention any specific context, I should stick with the standard interpretation.\\n\\nAnother angle: maybe the user is testing if I know the classic \"2+2=5\" from George Orwell\\'s 1984, which is a metaphor for truth being distorted under totalitarianism. But the user didn\\'t reference that, so probably not. They just want the mathematical answer.\\n\\nI should also consider if there\\'s any trick question here. Sometimes people ask 2+2 as a joke or to see if the responder is paying attention. But again, unless there\\'s a hint of that, it\\'s safe to assume it\\'s a straightforward question.\\n\\nLet me confirm with another method. If I have two apples and someone gives me two more, how many do I have? The answer is four. That\\'s practical, real-world application. So yes, 2+2 equals 4. No contradictions here.\\n\\nI think that\\'s solid. The answer is 4. No need to overcomplicate it unless the user provides more context. But since they didn\\'t, the answer is simple and direct.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe sum of 2 and 2 is **4**. This is a basic arithmetic calculation where adding the two numbers together results in 4.

The user wants me to extract the most relevant context from their conversation history. The messages provided are a summary of the conversation so far, which includes a previous search for hotels in New York and now a new request to search for hotels in Los Angeles.\\n\\nFirst, I need to identify the SESSION INTENT. The user's primary goal here is to search for hotels in Los Angeles. The previous interaction was about New York, but the latest message is a new query for LA. So the intent is clear.\\n\\nNext, the SUMMARY section. I need to highlight the key points: the user first asked for New York hotels, which were provided, and now they're switching to Los Angeles. The assistant should note that the previous search results for New York are no longer relevant and focus on the new request. Also, since the user hasn't selected a hotel yet, the next step is to perform the search for LA.\\n\\nFor ARTIFACTS, the previous tool call for New York and its results are part of the conversation history but might not be needed now. However, since the user is changing the location, the current step is to issue a new tool call for Los Angeles. So the artifacts would include the new tool call for LA and the upcoming results once they're retrieved.\\n\\nIn NEXT STEPS, the immediate action is to execute the search for Los Angeles hotels. After that, the assistant should present the results and offer further assistance similar to the previous interaction. The user might want details about specific hotels or proceed with booking, so the next steps should reflect that possibility.\\n\\nI need to make sure I don't include outdated information from the New York search in the summary. The focus is on the current request for Los Angeles. Also, check if there are any rejected options, but in this case, the user hasn't provided any alternatives, just a new location. \\n\\nWait, the user's latest message is a new query. The previous summary mentioned the New York search, but the current task is to handle the Los Angeles request. So the summary should reflect that the user has shifted the location, and the assistant needs to address that. The artifacts should include the new tool call for LA, not the previous one. That makes sense.\\n\\nAlso, the NEXT STEPS should be clear: perform the search, present results, and offer follow-up options.

The user has been asking for hotels in different cities: first New York, then Los Angeles, Chicago, and now Houston. Each time, I used the search_hotel tool and got a list of hotels, which I formatted into a numbered list. The pattern seems to be that the user wants a clean list of hotels without any extra formatting.\\n\\nLooking at the latest response from the tool, the hotels in Houston are listed with some inconsistent numbering and indentation. My job is to present this information clearly. I need to make sure the list is properly numbered from 1 to 8, just like the previous responses. Also, the user might be looking for a straightforward list without any markdown, so I should keep it simple.\\n\\nWait, the tool_response for Houston has entries like \"    1. Hotel A\" with leading spaces. That\\'s probably a formatting error. I should correct that by removing the extra spaces and ensuring each hotel is listed with the correct number. Also, there\\'s a repetition in numbering, like \"3. Hotel C.\" followed by \"    2. Hotel D\". That seems off. I need to renumber them sequentially from 1 to 8.\\n\\nLet me parse the tool_response again. The raw data is:\\n\\nHotels in city : Houston:\\n    1. Hotel A\\n2. Hotel B\\n3. Hotel C.\\n    2. Hotel D\\n3. Hotel E.\\n    3. Hotel F\\n4. Hotel G\\n5. Hotel H.\\n    \\nSo, the correct approach is to list each hotel with a unique number from 1 to 8, removing any leading spaces and fixing the numbering. The user expects a clean, easy-to-read list. After formatting, I should ask if they need more details or booking help, as in previous interactions. That way, the user knows the next steps are available. I need to make sure the response is consistent with how I presented Chicago and Los Angeles results. Alright, let\\'s structure the list correctly and maintain the same follow-up question.\\n'}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 497, 'prompt_tokens': 1182, 'total_tokens': 1679, 'completion_time': 1.030107169, 'completion_tokens_details': {'reasoning_tokens': 426}, 'prompt_time': 0.048832694, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.006738666, 'total_time': 1.078939863}, 'model_name': 'qwen/qwen3-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5cf921caa2', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'}, id='lc_run--019c3d9b-d0c4-7aa3-a3c7-bb1c15f49e99-0', tool_calls=[], invalid_tool_calls=[], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1182, 'output_tokens': 497, 'total_tokens': 1679, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 426}})]\n"

Hmm, adding fractions. Let me think. I remember that to add fractions, they have to have the same denominator. Right? If the denominators are different, you can't just add the numerators directly. So first, I need to find a common denominator for 1/2 and 1/3. \\n\\nThe denominators here are 2 and 3. What's the least common denominator of 2 and 3? Well, the least common multiple of 2 and 3. Let me think. Multiples of 2 are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12... and multiples of 3 are 3, 6, 9, 12... So the smallest common multiple is 6. So 6 is the least common denominator. \\n\\nOkay, so I need to convert both fractions to have 6 as the denominator. Starting with 1/2. To turn 2 into 6, I multiply the denominator by 3. So I have to do the same to the numerator. So 1 times 3 is 3, and denominator 2 times 3 is 6. So 1/2 is equivalent to 3/6. \\n\\nNow for 1/3. The denominator is 3, and we need to turn it into 6. Multiply denominator by 2, so 3 times 2 is 6. So numerator also has to be multiplied by 2. 1 times 2 is 2. So 1/3 is equivalent to 2/6. \\n\\nNow, adding the two converted fractions: 3/6 + 2/6. Since the denominators are the same, I can add the numerators. 3 + 2 is 5. So the sum is 5/6. \\n\\nWait, let me check if that's correct. If I add 1/2 and 1/3, does it equal 5/6? Let me verify with another method. Maybe convert them to decimals. 1/2 is 0.5, 1/3 is approximately 0.3333. Adding them together: 0.5 + 0.3333 = 0.8333... And 5/6 as a decimal is 0.8333... So that matches. Yeah, that seems right. \\n\\nAnother way to think about it: If I have half a pizza and a third of another pizza, how much do I have? If both pizzas are the same size, then converting to sixths, half is three sixths, third is two sixths. Total five sixths. That makes sense. \\n\\nIs there a way to do this without finding the least common denominator? Maybe by multiplying the denominators? Let's see. If I multiply 2 and 3, I get 6, which is the same as the LCD. So maybe that's why it works. But if denominators were not co-prime, like 4 and 6, then LCD is 12, but multiplying gives 24. So better to find LCD. But in this case, since 2 and 3 are co-prime, their product is the LCD. \\n\\nAlternatively, using the formula for adding fractions: (a/b + c/d) = (ad + bc)/bd. So here, a=1, b=2, c=1, d=3. Plugging in: (1*3 + 1*2)/(2*3) = (3 + 2)/6 = 5/6. Yep, same result. \\n\\nSo all methods lead to 5/6. Therefore, I think the answer is 5/6. \\n\\nJust to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let me go through the steps again. \\n\\n1/2 = 3/6 because 1*3=3 and 2*3=6. Correct. 1/3 = 2/6 because 1*2=2 and 3*2=6. Correct. Adding 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6. Yes. \\n\\nAlternatively, if I had chosen a different common denominator, like 12. Let's test that. 1/2 is 6/12, 1/3 is 4/12. Adding gives 10/12, which simplifies to 5/6. Same answer. So regardless of the common denominator chosen, as long as it's correct, the result is the same. \\n\\nSo, I think I've verified it multiple ways. The answer should be 5/6.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo solve the problem of adding the fractions $\\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{3}$, we follow these key steps:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 1: Find a Common Denominator\\n\\nTo add fractions, they must share the same denominator. The denominators in this case are 2 and 3. The **least common denominator (LCD)** of 2 and 3 is **6**, since 6 is the smallest number both 2 and 3 divide into evenly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 2: Convert Each Fraction to Have the Same Denominator\\n\\nWe convert each fraction to have the denominator 6:\\n\\n- $\\\\frac{1}{2} = \\\\frac{1 \\\\times 3}{2 \\\\times 3} = \\\\frac{3}{6}$\\n- $\\\\frac{1}{3} = \\\\frac{1 \\\\times 2}{3 \\\\times 2} = \\\\frac{2}{6}$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 3: Add the Fractions\\n\\nNow that both fractions have the same denominator, we can add the numerators:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{3}{6} + \\\\frac{2}{6} = \\\\frac{3 + 2}{6} = \\\\frac{5}{6}\\n$$\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 4: Simplify if Necessary\\n\\nThe fraction $\\\\frac{5}{6}$ is already in its simplest form.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Final Answer\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\boxed{\\\\frac{5}{6}}\\n$$\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1308, 'prompt_tokens': 20, 'total_tokens': 1328, 'completion_time': 2.182258454, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_time': 0.0006327, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.006267243, 'total_time': 2.182891154}, 'model_name': 'qwen/qwen3-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5cf921caa2', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'}, id='lc_run--019c3d9e-eded-7d03-b9b6-e56e6529a0b9-0', tool_calls=[], invalid_tool_calls=[], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 20, 'output_tokens': 1308, 'total_tokens': 1328})]}\n",

Yes, 6 divided by 2 is 3, and 20 divided by 2 is 10. So the simplified result is 3/10. Alternatively, I can verify by converting the fractions to decimals first. 3/4 is 0.75 and 2/5 is 0.4. Multiplying those gives 0.75 * 0.4 = 0.3, and 3/10 is 0.3, so that matches. Another way is cross-simplifying before multiplying. If I divide 3 and 5 by a common factor, but wait, 3 and 5 don't have common factors. Maybe I can cross-cancel with 4 and 2. The 4 and 2 can be simplified. Dividing 4 by 2 gives 2, and 2 by 2 gives 1. Then the problem becomes 3/2 * 1/5 = 3/10. Same result. Okay, that confirms the answer is correct. The user might just need the final answer, but explaining the steps would help them understand. Since the previous interactions involved verifying through multiple methods, I should include both the direct multiplication and the decimal verification to ensure clarity.\\n</think>\\n\\n## SESSION INTENT  \\nSolve the multiplication of fractions: $\\\\frac{3}{4} \\\\times \\\\frac{2}{5}$.  \\n\\n## SUMMARY  \\n1. **Multiplication Steps**:  \\n   - Multiply numerators: $3 \\\\times 2 = 6$.  \\n   - Multiply denominators: $4 \\\\times 5 = 20$.  \\n   - Result: $\\\\frac{6}{20}$, which simplifies to $\\\\frac{3}{10}$ (dividing numerator and denominator by 2).  \\n\\n2. **Verification**:  \\n   - Decimal conversion: $0.75 \\\\times 0.4 = 0.3$, equivalent to $\\\\frac{3}{10}$.  \\n   - Cross-simplification: Divide 4 and 2 by 2 before multiplying: $\\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\times \\\\frac{1}{5} = \\\\frac{3}{10}$.  \\n\\n## ARTIFACTS  \\nNone.  \\n\\n## NEXT STEPS  \\nNone.

First, they want me to add 5 and 7, which is straightforward. Then they want a detailed explanation of photosynthesis. Let me break this down.\\n\\nStarting with the addition: 5 + 7. That's simple arithmetic. The sum is 12. I'll just confirm that by counting or using basic math facts. No issues there.\\n\\nNow, the photosynthesis part. The user asked for a detailed explanation. I need to recall the process step by step. Let me start by outlining the main stages: light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle (light-independent reactions). \\n\\nFor the light-dependent reactions, I should mention where they occur—in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts. The process involves chlorophyll absorbing light, splitting water into oxygen, protons, and electrons (photolysis). This produces ATP and NADPH, which are energy carriers.\\n\\nThen the Calvin cycle happens in the stroma. It uses ATP and NADPH to fix carbon dioxide into glucose. I need to explain the three main steps: carbon fixation, reduction, and regeneration of the starting molecule (RuBP). Enzymes like RuBisCO are important here. Also, the role of ATP and NADPH in providing energy and electrons.\\n\\nWait, did I miss anything? Maybe the overall equation: 6CO2 + 6H2O → C6H12O6 + 6O2. That's a good summary. Also, the importance of chlorophyll and other pigments in capturing light energy. Oh, and the two types of photosynthesis in different plants, like C3, C4, and CAM, but the user didn't ask for that detail, so maybe keep it basic.\\n\\nI should structure the explanation clearly, starting with the purpose of photosynthesis, then the two main stages, and the overall equation. Make sure to use simple language and avoid jargon where possible. Check that each step is explained logically, connecting the light-dependent and light-independent reactions. Also, mention the role of chloroplasts and the necessity of sunlight.\\n\\nDouble-check the steps for accuracy. For example, in the Calvin cycle, the first step is fixing CO2 with RuBP, catalyzed by RuBisCO. Then the six-carbon compound splits into two 3-PGA molecules, which are reduced using ATP and NADPH to form G3P. Some G3P molecules go to glucose, while others regenerate RuBP. Need to mention that the cycle requires 3 turns to produce one G3P for glucose.\\n\\nAlso, highlight that oxygen is a byproduct from the splitting of water during light-dependent reactions. That's a key point. Make sure the explanation is comprehensive but not overly technical unless the user requests more depth. Alright, that should cover the detailed explanation they need.\\n</think>\\n\\n### **1. Addition of 5 and 7**  \\nThe sum of 5 and 7 is **12**. This is a basic arithmetic operation where 5 is added to 7, resulting in 12.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### **2. Photosynthesis: A Detailed Explanation**  \\n\\n#### **Purpose of Photosynthesis**  \\nPhotosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight, carbon dioxide (CO₂), and water (H₂O) into glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆), oxygen (O₂), and energy (ATP). It sustains life by producing oxygen and forming the foundation of the food chain.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **Stages of Photosynthesis**  \\n\\n**1. Light-Dependent Reactions (Light Reactions)**  \\n- **Location**: Thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts.  \\n- **Process**:  \\n  - **Light Absorption**: Chlorophyll in chloroplasts absorbs sunlight.  \\n  - **Water Splitting (Photolysis)**: Water molecules are split into oxygen (O₂), protons (H⁺), and electrons (e⁻).  \\n  - **Electron Transport Chain**: Electrons pass through proteins in the thylakoid membrane, releasing energy to pump protons into the thylakoid lumen.  \\n  - **ATP and NADPH Formation**:  \\n    - ATP is produced via **chemiosmosis** (protons flow through ATP synthase).  \\n    - NADPH is formed by electrons reducing NADP⁺.  \\n\\n**2. Light-Independent Reactions (Calvin Cycle)**  \\n- **Location**: Stroma of chloroplasts.  \\n- **Process**:  \\n  - **Carbon Fixation**: CO₂ from the atmosphere is combined with RuBP (a 5-carbon molecule) by the enzyme **RuBisCO**, forming 3-PGA (3-phosphoglycerate).  \\n  - **Reduction**: ATP and NADPH from light reactions provide energy and electrons to convert 3-PGA into G3P (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate).  \\n  - **Regeneration of RuBP**: Most G3P molecules are recycled to regenerate RuBP, requiring additional ATP.  \\n  - **Glucose Formation**: For every 3 CO₂ molecules processed (3 turns of the cycle), 1 G3P molecule exits to form glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆).  \\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **Overall Equation**  \\n$$\\n6\\\\text{CO}_2 + 6\\\\text{H}_2\\\\text{O} + \\\\text{light energy} \\\\rightarrow \\\\text{C}_6\\\\text{H}_{12}\\\\text{O}_6 + 6\\\\text{O}_2\\n$$  \\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **Key Components**  \\n- **Chlorophyll**: Captures light energy.  \\n- **ATP/NADPH**: Energy carriers produced in light reactions.  \\n- **RuBisCO**: The enzyme responsible for carbon fixation.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **Significance**  \\n- Produces oxygen as a byproduct, essential for aerobic life.  \\n- Converts solar energy into chemical energy (glucose), forming the basis of food and energy for ecosystems.  \\n\\nLet me know if you'd like further details (e.g., variations in C3, C4, or CAM plants)!\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1301, 'prompt_tokens': 593, 'total_tokens': 1894, 'completion_time': 2.52528878, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_time': 0.02539279, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.006168315, 'total_time': 2.55068157}, 'model_name': 'qwen/qwen3-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5cf921caa2', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'}, id='lc_run--019c3d9f-71e1-7fe2-b60a-907eb5998810-0', tool_calls=[], invalid_tool_calls=[], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 593, 'output_tokens': 1301, 'total_tokens': 1894})]}\n"
