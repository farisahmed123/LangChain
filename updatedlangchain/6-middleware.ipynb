If any are found, the middleware can block the request or return a warning, otherwise it lets the input continue to the main logic. This helps keep your application safe and clean without changing the core processing code."

That\\'s a basic arithmetic question. Let me start by recalling that addition is one of the fundamental operations in mathematics. When you add two numbers together, you\\'re combining their quantities. So 2 plus 2 would be 4. But wait, maybe I should double-check that. Let me count: 2 objects plus another 2 objects make a total of 4 objects. Yes, that seems right.\\n\\nI wonder if there\\'s any context where 2+2 could mean something else. In most everyday situations, it\\'s straightforward addition. But in some specialized fields, like modular arithmetic or different number bases, the result might vary. For example, in base 3, 2+2 would be 11 (which is 4 in decimal). However, unless specified otherwise, the default assumption is base 10. Since the question doesn\\'t mention any specific context, I should stick with the standard interpretation.\\n\\nAnother angle: maybe the user is testing if I know the classic \"2+2=5\" from George Orwell\\'s 1984, which is a metaphor for truth being distorted under totalitarianism. But the user didn\\'t reference that, so probably not. They just want the mathematical answer.\\n\\nI should also consider if there\\'s any trick question here. Sometimes people ask 2+2 as a joke or to see if the responder is paying attention. But again, unless there\\'s a hint of that, it\\'s safe to assume it\\'s a straightforward question.\\n\\nLet me confirm with another method. If I have two apples and someone gives me two more, how many do I have? The answer is four. That\\'s practical, real-world application. So yes, 2+2 equals 4. No contradictions here.\\n\\nI think that\\'s solid. The answer is 4. No need to overcomplicate it unless the user provides more context. But since they didn\\'t, the answer is simple and direct.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe sum of 2 and 2 is **4**. This is a basic arithmetic calculation where adding the two numbers together results in 4.
