    "Suppose you want to check if a user’s input contains any banned words before processing it in LangChain. You can use middleware to scan the input for banned words. If any are found, the middleware can block the request or return a warning, otherwise it lets the input continue to the main logic. This helps keep your application safe and clean without changing the core processing code."
